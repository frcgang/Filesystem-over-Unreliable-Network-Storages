# Filesystem-over-Unreliable-Network-Storages
(EXPERIMENTAL ONLY) FUNS provides a linux file system over legacy file transfer protocols such as ftp, webdav, and so on.

Not for pratical use yet. We should add more functions for real usage environment, such as concurrency handling, user interface for management and others. And more optimization may enhance the performance.

RS code related sources are modified from those of RSCODE project, http://rscode.sourceforge.net of GPL license.
